title: Hacking the Amazon Dash button
---

Like most others, I treated Amazon's dash button concept as a flight of fancy. Quickly dismissing it, I never bothered about the buttons. Until now! Not long ago, I undertook the project of connecting my car garage to the internet. More than anything, it was to get my feet wet with the emerging IoT wave. After implementing it, I felt the need for a generic physical button to act as a trigger. I saw a few products online, but didn't take the plunge due to the cost. Spending $40-80 for a [button](https://bt.tn/shop/), didn't seem right. Then I found an article, where someone had hacked the $5 Amazon Dash button and made it work as an IoT button. Voila!

I ordered one and followed the article to sucessfully set it up. The [setup](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8) involves partially setting up to button and then detecting ARP probes.

I did not feel the constant probe monitoring to be efficient, so took a different approach to detect button presses . I use [Tomato](http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?forums/tomato-firmware.33/) firmware on my router and therefore, was able to achieve this by using DNSMASQ. This had the advantage of running completely in the router without a need for a separate machine running the probe program. I created firewall rules to reject DNS and HTTPS traffic generated by the button ( REJECT instead of DROP, as button tries longer to get online with DROP). Dash button does not maintain persistent connections, instead upon pressing the button, it powers up and tries to connect to the Wifi. DNSMASQ detects this and using its `dhcp-script`, I was able to trigger a custom shell script on this. The button tries to make internet connections, but the firewall rejects all such traffic. One thing to notice is that, this script trigger happens whenever DNSMASQ starts up, or the lease renews/expires. But as we are only interested in triggers when the button is actually pressed, we can employ the `DNSMASQ_SUPPLIED_HOSTNAME` environment variable to make this distinction. It is only supplied for actions when a host joins or resumes an existing lease, since this data are not held by dnsmasq's lease database. So, with this setup, I was able to use a push notification mechanism instead of the probe monitoring pull mechanism. I'm pleased with the functionality, these little buttons provide for $5, after being hacked. Give these little marvels a shot.
